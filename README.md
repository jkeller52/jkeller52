ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jkeller52
- I'm a MS Candidate and Graduate Research Associate in the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering at Ohio State University. My research interests are centered around designing better human-robot systems in complex environments like space operations, disaster response, and air traffic management. 
- In the last eight months, I've begun developing skills in Python and C++ to support my research in work-centered computational modeling and simulation of human-machine teams.
- Aside from my research, I'm interested in Internet of Things (IoT) projects, and also recently have become interested in blockchain technology, specifically in the development of decentralized apps for Ethereum using Python. I will be uploading projects in this realm soon.

My notable projects on this page include:
- [CSEL Astrobee](https://github.com/jkeller52/astrobee): An installation and configuration guide for NASA's Astrobee simulation using ROS and Gazebo. This initial effort will be folded into the development of an experimental testbed using the Astrobee platform to study human-robot interaction in the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State University (note: no current official affiliation with NASA).
- [pigui](https://github.com/jkeller52/pigui): An Internet-of-Things automation project using a Raspberry Pi with 3.5" Touchscreen to facilitate command and control of personal devices. I am in the process of creating documentation for a beginner-friendly tutorial for others.
