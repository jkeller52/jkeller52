ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jkeller52
- I'm a MS Candidate and Graduate Research Associate in the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering at Ohio State University. My research interests are centered around  designing better human-robot systems in complex environments like space operations, disaster response, and air traffic management. 
- In the last eight months, I've begun developing skills in Python and C++ to support my research in work-centered computational modeling and simulation of human-machine teams.
- Aside from my research, I've also recently become interested in blockchain technology, specifically in the development of decentralized apps for Ethereum using Python. I will be uploading projects in this realm soon.

My notable projects on this page include:
- [pigui](https://github.com/jkeller52/pigui): An Internet-of-Things automation project using a Raspberry Pi with 3.5" Touchscreen to facilitate command and control of personal devices. I am in the process of creating documentation for a beginner-friendly tutorial for others. 
- [website](https://github.com/jkeller52/jkeller52.github.io): Created Jekyll-based professional website, configured to suit my needs and customized to contain my portfolio, resume, and more.
