### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jacob!


### I'm a MS Candidate and Graduate Researcher at Ohio State University.

I am specifically developing skills in Python and C++ to support my research in work-centered computational modeling and simulation of human-machine teams.

My research interests are centered around improving human-robot systems in complex environments like space operations, disaster response, and air traffic management.
