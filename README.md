### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jacob!


## I'm a MS Candidate and Graduate Researcher at Ohio State University.


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything ðŸ¤£ I am specifically developing skills in Python and C++ to support my research in work-centered computational modeling and simulation of human-machine teams.
- ðŸ”¬ My research interests are centered around improving human-robot systems in complex environments like space operations, disaster response, and air traffic management. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing saxphone, doing DIY projects, playing video games, and taking astrophotography shots of the night sky

My notable projects on this page include:
- [CSEL Astrobee](https://github.com/jkeller52/astrobee): An installation and configuration guide for NASA's Astrobee simulation platform using ROS and Gazebo. This initial effort will be folded into the development of an experimental testbed using the Astrobee platform to study human-robot interaction in the Cognitive Systems Engineering Laboratory at Ohio State University (note: no current official affiliation with NASA).
- [pigui](https://github.com/jkeller52/pigui): An Internet-of-Things automation project using a Raspberry Pi with 3.5" Touchscreen to facilitate command and control of personal devices. I am in the process of creating documentation for a beginner-friendly tutorial for others.
