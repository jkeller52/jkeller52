### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jacob

I'm an Exploration Engineer for Jacobs at NASA Johnson Space Center.  

In my current role, I directly contribute to user interface design, testing, and systems integration for EVA Mission Systems Software (EMSS)[^1](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240001870)[^2](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021LPICo2549.7016M/abstract)[^3](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/items/ebd7ceef-0e7d-4f06-9829-6d2b5fd8a64b) tools at NASA JSC.

I hold a Master's Degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from Ohio State University, where my research focused on human-automation interaction, user interface and decision-support software system development, and ethnographic methods/work-domain analysis.
