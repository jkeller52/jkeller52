- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jkeller52
I'm interested in improving my coding skills to support my interest in designing better human-robot systems in complex environments like space operations, disaster response, and air traffic management.

- I've recently become interested in developing d-apps for thee Ethereum blockchain using Python - I will be uploading more projects in this realm soon.



Check out my personal site for more info.
