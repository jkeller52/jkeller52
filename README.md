ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jkeller52
-I'm a MS Candidate and Graduate Research Associate in the Department of Integrated Systems Engineering at Ohio State University. My research interests are centered around  designing better human-robot systems in complex environments like space operations, disaster response, and air traffic management. I've recently begun my coding journey to develop skills in Python and C++. These skills will support the use of modeling and ismulation capabilities to analyze and evaluate the performance of human-machine teams in complex work environments. 
-------
My notable projects on this page include:
- pigui: An Internet-of-Things automation project using a Raspberry Pi with 3.5" Touchscreen to facilitate command and control of personal devices
- website: Created Jekyll-based professional website



I've recently become interested in developing d-apps for thee Ethereum blockchain using Python - I will be uploading more projects in this realm soon.
