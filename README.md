### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jacob


### I'm a Grad Student Researcher at Ohio State University.

I'm learning programming in Python, JavaScript, and C++. I have a variety of personal projects involving coding, 3D printing, soldering, and other related hobbies.

My interest in gaining these skills also has practical applications, as my research interests are centered around improving human-robot systems in complex environments like space operations, disaster response, and air traffic management.
